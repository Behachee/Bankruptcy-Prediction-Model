# Bankruptcy-Prediction-Model
## Introduction
Bankruptcy is a state of insolvency when a business or legal person cannot repay debts to creditors. Bankruptcy is primarily imposed by court order when initiated by the debtor. In this article, I will walk you through how to train a bankruptcy prediction model with machine learning using Python.

## Bankruptcy Prediction Model with Machine Learning
Bankruptcy is the concept of financial accounts. If you are one of the data science enthusiasts who started with data science after commerce then you should be aware of what bankruptcy is. When a business or legal person fails to pay the debts of creditors and becomes insolvent at some point, this type of situation is called bankruptcy.

By using machine learning algorithms we can train a model to predict whether a company or a legal person will become bankrupt in future or not. In the section below, I will take you through a machine learning tutorial on how to train a model for the task of bankruptcy prediction of a company by using the Python programming language.

## Bankruptcy Prediction Model using Python
The dataset that I will be using for this task is collected from Kaggle and it is provided by the Taiwan Economic Journal. Now let’s import the dataset and the necessary Python libraries to start with the task of training a bankruptcy prediction model using Python
